# Refund Policy

**Last Updated: April 13, 2025**

At AutoCommentAI, a service provided by ZHU GE ("we", "our", or "us"), we are committed to ensuring your complete satisfaction with our AI comment generation service. This Refund Policy explains when and how you can request a refund after purchasing credits.

## Refund Eligibility

### Unused Credits Refund

We offer proportional refunds for unused credits according to the following rules:

1. **Refund Calculation**: The refund amount is based on the percentage of unused credits remaining in your account at the time of your refund request, and is calculated based on the total amount you actually paid for the credits (no processing fees are deducted).

   For example:
   - If you purchased the Starter plan (250 credits for \$5), and you have used 30 credits, you are eligible for a refund of 70% of \$5, which is \$3.50.
   - If you purchased the Standard plan (550 credits for \$10), and you have used 100 credits, you are eligible for a refund of about 81.8% of \$10 (remaining 450/550), which is \$8.18.
   - If you purchased the Professional plan (1800 credits for \$30), and you have used 300 credits, you are eligible for a refund of about 83.3% of \$30 (remaining 1500/1800), which is \$25.00.
   - If you purchased the Enterprise plan, please contact us for pricing.

2. **Minimum Refund Threshold**: Refund requests are only accepted if you have at least 10% of the original purchased credits remaining in your account.

3. **Time Limitation**: Refund requests must be submitted within 90 days of the original purchase date.

### Technical Issues

If you experience technical issues that prevent you from using the service or generating comments (while you still have available credits), we may, at our discretion, provide a full or partial refund.

### Accidental Purchases

If you made a duplicate or unintended purchase by mistake, please contact us within 24 hours and we will consider a full refund. The refund amount will be based on the total amount you paid.

# Privacy Policy

_Last updated: June 2025_

This Privacy Policy explains how AutoCommentAI, a service provided by ZHU GE ("AutoCommentAI", "we", "us", or "our"), handles your information when you use our Chrome extension. Your privacy is our top priority.

## 1. Data Collection

**We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information.** All your data—including links, preferences, and settings—remains strictly on your local device and is never uploaded to our servers or any third party.

## 2. Data Usage

- All features, including comment generation, style settings, and link management, operate entirely within your browser.
- No personal data, browsing history, or comment content is sent to us or any external service.
- The extension only accesses the content of web pages to extract main text and fill comment forms as per your request. This data is processed locally and never leaves your device.

## 3. Data Storage

- All user data (such as preferences, links, and settings) is stored locally in your browser's storage.
- We do not have access to, nor do we back up, any of your data.

## 4. Local Privacy First

- Your privacy is protected by design. AutoCommentAI does not require you to create an account or provide any personal information.
- All AI-powered comment generation and customization are performed without transmitting your data externally.

## 5. Third-Party Services

- AutoCommentAI does not integrate with or share data with any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.
- The extension may use browser APIs and, if applicable, AI APIs to generate comments, but your content and preferences are never sent to us or any third party.

## 6. User Rights

- You have full control over your data. You can clear or modify your preferences and stored links at any time via the extension's settings.
- Since we do not collect or store any personal data, there is no data for us to provide, modify, or delete on your behalf.

## 7. Security

- All processing is done locally in your browser, minimizing any risk of data exposure.
- We recommend keeping your browser and extension updated to ensure the latest security protections.

## 8. Children's Privacy

- AutoCommentAI is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children.

## 9. Changes to This Policy

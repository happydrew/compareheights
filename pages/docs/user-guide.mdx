# Welcome to AutoCommentAI üéâ

### 4. Viewing Auto-Extracted Page Content

Navigate to any page where you want to submit a comment (blogs, forums, news articles, etc.). Click the side button to expand the panel. The extension will automatically extract the main content of the page into the text box and detect the page's language for comment generation (you can also manually select a different language). If extraction fails, you can manually copy and paste the content into the text box.

### 5. Configuring Generation Options

The extension offers various settings: persona, comment style, interactivity, link embedding, link format, comment length, and the number of comments to generate at once.

-   **Customize Setting Visibility**
    Most settings are hidden by default. Click the yellow gear icon to show all options. Use the eye icon next to each option to toggle its visibility.
    
    ![Toogle Settings](/assets/docs/user-guide/toggle-settings.png)

-   **Persona:** Defines the commenter's role. Current options include: Curious Redditor, Sarcastic Techie, Warm Companion, Straightforward Critic, and Trendy Jokester. Each persona has a detailed prompt that guides the AI's generation style.
-   **Comment Style:** Sets the tone of the comment. Options: Lighthearted & Humorous, Sincere & Emotional, Crisp & Direct, Artistic & Lyrical, and Personal Anecdote.
-   **Interactivity:** Determines if and how the comment encourages interaction. Options: No Interaction, Guiding Question, Shared Resonance, Humorous Follow-up, and Friendly Debate.
-   **Comment Length:** Sets the length of the comments. Options: Short (1-2 sentences), Medium (3-5 sentences), and Long (6-8 sentences).
-   **Generate Chinese Comment:** When enabled, a Chinese version of the comment will also be generated. Default is on.
-   **Show Link Cards:** When disabled, the link cards in the "My Links" section will be hidden. Default is on.

We welcome feedback and suggestions if you have custom needs for these settings.

### 6. Setting Up Embedded Links

This feature naturally weaves your website information and a hyperlink into the generated comment.

-   **Enable Link Embedding:** Toggle the "Embed Link" switch in the side panel.
-   **Set Link Format:** Choose from four formats: `<a> tag`, `Markdown`, `BBCode`, or `raw URL`, covering almost all use cases.
-   **Set Anchor Text (Optional):**
    1.  **Title:** Uses the link's title as anchor text.
    2.  **Manual Select:** Manually choose an anchor text from the link's predefined list via a dropdown on the link card.
    3.  **Random:** Randomly selects an anchor text from the list.
    4.  **AI Generated:** Lets the AI generate context-aware anchor text based on the page content and link description.
-   **`<a>` Tag Attributes (Optional):** If using the `<a>` tag format, you can set `rel` and `target` attributes, as some blogs have specific requirements.

### 7. Selecting Links to Embed (Optional)

If link embedding is enabled, you must select which links to insert. The number of selected links should match the number of comments you're generating. For example, if you generate 3 comments, select 3 links, and each comment will be embedded with one of them respectively.

-   **"My Links" Section Explained**
    You can select links using either horizontally scrolling cards or a dropdown list.
    
    <br />
    <Image src="/assets/docs/user-guide/select-links.png" alt="Select Links" width={400} height={500}/>

    -   **Link Cards:** Each link is displayed as a card showing its title, URL, and email.
    -   **Card Scrolling:** Scroll through your links using the side arrows or your mouse wheel. The centrally positioned card (highlighted) is the one that will be used for autofilling the form.
    -   **Selecting a Link:** Click a card to select it for embedding. Links are bound to comments in the order they are selected.
    -   **Dropdown Selection:** Use the dropdown menu as an alternative to scrolling cards.
    
    <br />
    <Image src="/assets/docs/user-guide/dropdown-select-links.png" alt="Dropdown Select Links" width={400} height={500}/>

-   **Comment and Link Syncing**
    When you scroll through the link cards, the card in the center gets a golden border. This central card is synced with the comment display. Scrolling to the next link will also scroll to its corresponding comment, and vice versa.

### 8. Generating Comments

Click the "Generate Comments" button at the bottom. Generating a single comment takes a few seconds; multiple comments may take up to 10 seconds. The credit cost is displayed on the button before you click.

### 9. Autofilling the Comment Form

1.  **Automatic Form Detection**
    The extension automatically detects comment forms on the page and indicates them below the "Autofill" button. Clicking the "Detected N forms" text will highlight the detected forms on the page with a blue pulsing border and a label, and scroll the page to their location.
    
    ![Auto detected forms](/assets/docs/user-guide/auto-detect-forms.png)

    *Note: Form detection is not 100% perfect. If a field isn't detected correctly, you can manually copy and paste the content. Hover over link cards or comments to find copy buttons.*
2.  **Autofill**
    After generating comments, click the "Autofill" button. This will populate the detected form fields with the content from the current comment and the information (name, URL, email) from the central (golden-bordered) link card.
    
    <br />
    <Image src="/assets/docs/user-guide/auto-fill.png" alt="Auto Fill" width={400} height={500}/>

3.  **Comment and Link Syncing for Autofill**
    If you generated comments with the "Embed Link" option enabled, each comment is tied to a specific link. Scrolling through your comments will automatically bring the corresponding link card to the central position, and vice-versa. This simplifies the process of promoting multiple sites, as you only need to scroll and click "Autofill" for each comment/link pair.

### 10. Additional Notes

1.  **Local Link Storage:** Your link data is stored in your browser's local storage for privacy reasons. Be cautious when clearing your browser cache, as this will permanently delete all your link data.
2.  **Local Configuration Storage:** Your settings are also stored locally and will be lost if you clear your browser cache.
3.  **Plugin Updates:** Chrome extension auto-updates can be delayed. It's recommended to update manually.
    üìå **Manual Update Steps:**

    üëâ Click the extensions icon in the top-right of your browser.
    üëâ Click "Manage Extensions."
    üëâ Enable "Developer mode" in the top-right.
    üëâ Click the "Update" button on the left.

## Typical Usage Patterns

1.  **Promoting a Single Website (Single Comment Generation)**
    This is the simplest mode. Generate one comment at a time, with or without an embedded link. This is the basic use case for AutoCommentAI.
2.  **Promoting Multiple Websites (Batch Comment Generation)**
    In this mode, you'll switch between multiple links and comments. AutoCommentAI's syncing mechanism streamlines this process, saving time and increasing efficiency even when promoting several sites at once.
